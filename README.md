Ukrainian Drama Corpus (UDraCor)

This repository contains texts of Ukrainian plays written in the XIX and early XX century. The plays are encoded in [TEI/XML](https://tei-c.org/). The TEI documents in this repository are being produced from a variety of sources, namely:

* ukrlib.com.ua
* litopys.org.ua
* myslenedrevo.com.ua
* l-ukrainka.name
* i-franko.name

and some others. The list of plays to be encoded is curated by Dr. Bohdan Tokarskyi and Daniil Skorinkin. The current list (153 plays) and the status of their encoding can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVHVsWkMYdiwu1N3me-QpboGPDEKb7RiYaL2Y1SwhvE/edit?usp=sharing)
